Description:
The DGRF and IGRF candidates of models for the geomagnetic main field in 2015 and 2020 are based on a parent model that is derived from ground-based and satellite virtual observatory data during the period 1957 and 2019.5. From these data annual differences are computed, which are used as model input for the parent model. This model is continuous in time and the Gauss coefficients are parameterised in time by order-6 B-splines. The temporal constraint of the parent model is to minimise the roughness of the second time derivative of the radial field component integrated over the core surface. It is also constrained to fit a satellite-based magnetic core field model in 2015. This is similar to C3FM (Wardinski & Holme, 2006) and C3FM2 (Wardinski & Lesur, 2012). The secular variation forecast is derived using a multivariate singular spectrum analysis of the observed past secular variation between 1957 and 2019. More details will be provided in a model paper submitted to the EPS special issue for IGRF generation 13.
